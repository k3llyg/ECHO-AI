# ECHO-VOICE-AI
Echo is an AI companion system designed for individuals who hope to resurrect their deceased loved ones digitally. This speculative design project is set in 2040 after another global pandemic took away the lives of millions and drastically increased loneliness, depression, and social isolation. It aims to help individuals cope with different stages of grief and spark reflections upon technology, mortality, privacy, identity, and the Ship of Theseus paradox. However, the device also has alternative use cases, such as alleviating homesickness by imitating the users’ closed ones and facilitating social networking experiences with other nearby users. Echo’s interaction modalities include speech, proxemics, and direct touch. The system has three key features: real-time contextualised conversations, NFC memory projections, and NFC audio visualization of audio messages legacy. The conversing functionalities is prototyped using node.js, Express, customisable GPT model training, Langchain frameworks. Likewise, memory projection and NFC games is  prototyped with p5.js and NFC stickers.
